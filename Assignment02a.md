A summary of what I have learned

with markdown, you can style your texts, use ordered and unordered lists, embed images 

and links you can as well style your codes because GitHub supports  fencing and syntax highlighting  

GitHub provides useful features such as syntax highlighting, tables, and SHA references 

you can also @mention people or an organization to view the comment 

automatic linking for URLs and most importantly Emojis ;D
