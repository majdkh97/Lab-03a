JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
you can use javascript in the browser to access content of a page, modify their contents, program rules or instructions that the browser can follow and react to events triggered by users on the browser 
just like any other languages JavaScript has its variable naming rules like it must not begin with a number
there is 2 ways to create an array the first one is called array literal you use square brackets to specify the values
the other one is called  array constructor you have to use the keyword Array(); and the values are specified in ()
