The web is a system for publishing pages of information on the internet, and for linking pages together using links.

Anyone can publish a page by uploading it to a web server. Anyone can read that page by typing its address into a web browser.

The web is based on the idea of ’hypertext’. This implies that texts can be embedded inside other texts.

Web pages are written in text with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), then uploaded to a host computer running web server software.
