## Comparison and logical operators

|        **Operator**       |          **Description**          |
| :-------------------------| :-------------------------------- |
|  ==                       |  equal to                         |
|  ===                      |  equal value and equal type       | 
|  !=                       |  not equal                        |
| !==                       |  not equal value or not equal type|
|  >                        |  greater than                     |        
|  <                        |  less than                        |  
|  >=                       |  greater than or equal to         |  
|  <=                       |  greater than or equal to         |    

## Loops

Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false 

**All for loops can be written as while loops, and vice-versa. Just use whichever loop seems more appropriate to the task at hand.
In general, you should use a for loop when you know how many times the loop should run. If you want the loop to break based on a condition other than the number of times it runs, you should use a while loop.**
