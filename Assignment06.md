# Defining Colors in CSS

## There are several different ways to specify colors in CSS.

 * Color Keywords : The first and easiest way to specify a color is using one of the 140 predefined color keywords specified in CSS.

 * RGB : RGB, which stands for red, green, and blue is the color model that monitors use.
    1. RGB colors have three values that represent: red, green, and blue
    2. Each value can be a number between 0 and 255 or a percentage from 0 to 100%
    3. A value of 0 means none of that color is being used
    4. A value of 255 or 100% means all of that color is being used
    5. A 0 for all three color values will be black
    6. A 255 or 100% for all three color values will be white

 * RGBA : it's just like RGB, except with the addition of a fourth value: the alpha channel.

        The alpha value represents the level of transparency that the rgb color should have. It can be a value from 0 to 1 or a percentage from 0 to 100%. Note that you must specify RGBA instead of RGB.

 * HSL : HSL stands for: hue, saturation, and lightness.
        Hue is defined by a color wheel. Each color represents a degree on the wheel.

 * HSLA : HSLA is simply the HSL color model with the addition of an alpha channel.

 * Hexadecimal : Probably the most common (yet least intuitive) way to specify colors in CSS is to use their hexadecimal (or hex) values. Hex values are actually just a different way to represent RGB values. Instead of using three numbers between 0 and 255, you use six hexadecimal numbers. Hex numbers can be 0-9 and A-F. Hex values are always prefixed with a # symbol.
