Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

With Git, you can control the version of your system. Git basically tracks the changes in the project files, because of this you can work on those files among multiple people since all changes are controlled. Git tracks every kind of file. And, since you keep all the history of your files, you can roll back for a specific part of your project.
